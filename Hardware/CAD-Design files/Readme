These are all the CAD design files you need to build the robotic actuator.

I am making multiple iterations first with 3d printed parts.


I am using PLA for 3D printing, although it is not very heat-resistant. I personally use a Bambu Lab A1 printer, which can not print with ABS or any other heat-resistant material.
 for the following final build I am planning on using Aluminum 6061-T6(still not decided yet as it is very expensive to get it machined.)

Why Choose 6061-T6?
✅ Lightweight – High strength-to-weight ratio.
✅ High Strength – Suitable for structural and load-bearing parts.
✅ Corrosion Resistance – Good resistance to oxidation.
✅ Machinability – Easy to CNC machine, drill, and tap.
✅ Thermal Conductivity – Helps dissipate heat from the motor.

Alternative Aluminum Choices:
7075-T6 → Stronger but more expensive and harder to machine.
5052-H32 → Good for sheet metal parts, not as strong as 6061.


In designing this actuator, I had to perform numerous calculations, all of which I will include.
Every dimension is chosen with purpose—nothing in mechanical engineering is random.
I firmly believe that every design decision has a reason, driven by physics, functionality, and efficiency.
