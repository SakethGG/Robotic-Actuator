# Robotic-Actuator
This is a high-performance robotic actuator designed for dynamic and agile motion, inspired by the MIT Mini Cheetah. It features precision torque control, field-oriented control (FOC), and advanced motor driver integration, making it ideal for quadruped robots, exoskeletons, and robotic arms.
