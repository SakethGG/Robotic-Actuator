# Robotic-Actuator
This is a high-performance robotic actuator designed for dynamic and agile motion, inspired by the MIT Mini Cheetah. It features precision torque control, field-oriented control (FOC), and advanced motor driver integration, making it ideal for quadruped robots, exoskeletons, and robotic arms. 













IGNORE THIS:(target is to complete the design process by the end of this month)
Keeping track of what I do every day to improve my efficiency and 



3/2/25:
-did some research on the motor and went to multiple design iterations,
-read multiple papers: made a basic understanding of the key components
-explored different types of actuators like proprioceptive actuators, hydraulic actuators, serial elastic actuators 
-made a basic model in design.
